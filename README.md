## Introduction

Made as a fun project to help me practice, improve and display my coding skills. It might even help me building new D&D characters someday once it's progressed further!

### Aims

Provide an easy way to roll a new D&D character.

Practice, improve and demonstrate what we can do with fundamental coding languages. In particular JQuery and SCSS.

## Technologies

- HTML
- JavaScript/JQuery

## Launch

Running this project locally should be nice and easy!

### Prerequisites: None

### Running: Once you've downloaded and unzipped the repo file, simply open up the index.html in your browser.


## Built With

- Visual Studio Code

- Chrome Devtools

## Author Notes

This was a project I had started to plan within my mind back when I was doing the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course on FreeCodeCamp. A D&D character builder felt like it would be the perfect fit for combining the function and algorithm building I was learning with JavaScript Objects.

I could already picture storing the different characteristics for a race, such as base height. Then taking that information and combining it with the result of a dice roller algorithm to produce a characters height value. It would work just like when using a paper and pen, the book and rolling real dice, but on screen.

I also thought this would be a great way to practice JQuery, which I'd learned a bit about on the Front End Development Libraries course on FreeCodeCamp but hadn't used until now. I'd like to combine this with SCSS when working on the aesthetic design of the project as it'd be great to practice using that some more too.
